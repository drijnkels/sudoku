## Simple Sudoku
A simple Sudoku app meant to work well on a mobile device without all the ads. Currently, a work in progress.

**Todos:**
- Error check on each new digit entered
- Auto remove notes when a digit is placed
- Mark a Soduku complete when all digits are in the correct place
- Actually check that it works well on a mobile device
- Increase number of Sudoku available (Open source lib?)
- Sort Sudoku by difficulty
- Hints?

## Running locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `/src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
